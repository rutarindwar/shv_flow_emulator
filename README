C translation of the emulator code from the juq paper.
A workflow would be:
1) Run dataReader: this reads pileheight records, and save heights at all locations
2) Run designAuto: this choose the right design for a particular location
3) Run flowEm : this fit a Gaussian process over the subdesign created in the step above and compute the inundation contours.
